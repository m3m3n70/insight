See example here: http://104.236.155.212/

Currently, this is a proof of concept

```
$ export PORT=8000
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

Open localhost:8000 in your browser


## TODO
1. Refactor all the things! Add gulp and better directory structure
2. Move project and api key to environment variables
3. Style it all
4. Add more advanced visualizations
